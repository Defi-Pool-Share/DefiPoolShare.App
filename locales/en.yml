  title: Transform your AMM pool shares into a powerful earning tool

      title: Why using it?
      txt: |
        Earn instant ETH by lending your Uniswap V3 pool share NFTs. Set your lending fee and lock in your NFT of the AMM pair share you have. When a borrower chooses your NFT, you'll receive ETH equivalent to month's worth of fees generated by your LP. With discounted fees to incentivize borrowers, the smart contract takes care of the rest. No more waiting for months to accumulate fees profits.

      title: How it works
      txt: |
        Potential borrowers can bid on your locked NFT LPs, offering a price to borrow it for a set period. Once a bid is accepted, the borrower pays you the lending fee you asked for having access to your LP for the period and gains access to the Uniswap V3 pool fees. At the end of the loan period, our smart-contract returns the pool share to you, and you receive your NFT back.
