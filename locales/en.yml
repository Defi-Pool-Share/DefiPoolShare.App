        Direct on-chain peer-to-peer lending and borrowing of Uniswap V3 pool positions. Lend your potential yield for a specific period to an interested borrower or borrow someone else’s yields for a fraction of the total liquidity provided in that position.

        Blue-chip pool positions offer more predictable returns with even lesser risks of impermanent loss. Simply lend pool positions to institutional LP Managers or use our analytical tools to effectively manage your LP Positions.

      title: Yield Casing
      txt: |
        LP Pool positions are analyzed by our partner LLM agents on various metrics like the estimated yield that can be generated in the loan duration based on historical data, market sentiments, how much total liquidity is there on the specific pool, volatility, lending terms etc. Then the LLM categorizes these Pool Positions in terms of Potential & Risk so you can make more informed decisions.

    uniswap: |
      Below, you'll find a list of the Uniswap LP NFTs in your possession. When you contribute liquidity to a trading pair on Uniswap, you are given an NFT that signifies your stake in that specific pool. This NFT can be loaned out on DeFi Pool Share. To determine a suitable borrowing price for prospective borrowers, it's important to know the percentage of the initial pool that you own, as this will give you an idea of your LP NFT's lending value.
    lenders: |
      This list displays the LP pool positions  you have offered for borrowing or those that are currently being borrowed. You can track their status and, when the loan period concludes, retrieve your LP NFT. After the loan has been completed, you may choose to offer your liquidity positions for borrowing once more, for a specified duration. This allows you to efficiently manage your assets and share them with others in the marketplace.
    borrowers: |
      With the DeFi Pool Share Protocol app, you can borrow listed LP pool positions from others. During the loan period, you'll be able to claim the fees generated by the pool during the loan duration  using the smart contract. It's a simple way to utilize borrowed assets and benefit from their rewards, However, once the loan duration ends, you'll lose access to the LP pool position, and the LP NFT will be returned to the original owner. This system offers a straightforward and accessible way to engage with DeFi opportunities.
