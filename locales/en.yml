      title: Why use it?
      txt: |
        Earn instant upfront ETH by lending your Uniswap V3 pool position NFTs. Set your lending fee and lock in your Pool positions. When a borrower chooses your NFT, you'll receive ETH equivalent to Loan Duration’s worth of fees generated by your LP. Borrowers are incentived to borrow the position based on discount on top of estimated fees the position would generate for the loan duration.

      txt: |
        Potential borrowers can bid on Listed LP Pool positions, offering a fees to borrow it for a set period of time. Once a bid is accepted, the borrower pays lending fee giving borrower access to the claim fees function of the  Uniswap V3 Pool position for the set period. Once the loan duration is over, our smart-contract returns the Pool position back to the Lender.

      Below, you'll find a list of the Uniswap LP NFTs in your possession. When you contribute liquidity to a trading pair on Uniswap, you are given an NFT that signifies your stake in that specific pool. This NFT can be loaned out on DeFi Pool Share. To determine a suitable borrowing price for prospective borrowers, it's important to know the percentage of the initial pool that you own, as this will give you an idea of your LP NFT's lending value.
    lenders: |
      This list displays the LP pool positions  you have offered for borrowing or those that are currently being borrowed. You can track their status and, when the loan period concludes, retrieve your LP NFT. After the loan has been completed, you may choose to offer your liquidity positions for borrowing once more, for a specified duration. This allows you to efficiently manage your assets and share them with others in the marketplace.
    borrowers: |
      With the DeFi Pool Share Protocol app, you can borrow listed LP pool positions from others. During the loan period, you'll be able to claim the fees generated by the pool during the loan duration  using the smart contract. It's a simple way to utilize borrowed assets and benefit from their rewards, However, once the loan duration ends, you'll lose access to the LP pool position, and the LP NFT will be returned to the original owner. This system offers a straightforward and accessible way to engage with DeFi opportunities.
